## Overview

A component to simulate WebXR XRPlanes, while running on a desktop system

## Schema

This component has no schema.  Simulated planes are configured via the plane geometry configured on the same element.

## Usage

Configure an `a-plane` (or other element with a `plane` geometry) with the desired position, size, rotation and appearance (can be invisible if desired)

Then add the `desktop-xr-plane`component 

```
<a-plane width="2"
         height="2"
         position="1 1 0"
         rotation="0 -90 0"
         color="white"
         wireframe="true"
         desktop-xr-plane>
</a-plane>
```



## Limitations

Does not support the `scale` attribute on the element - scale is assumed to be `1 1 1`

Only supports rectangles.  The WebXR standard supports XRPlanes that are arbitrary polygons, so this is a limitation vs. the WebXR standard.  However note that as of July 2023, the Meta Quest room setup process always generates rectangles (even for the ceiling and floor of a non-rectangular room).  So it's possible to simulate all XRPlanes that can be generated by Meta Quest room setup.



## Installation
