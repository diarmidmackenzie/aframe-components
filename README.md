# aframe-examples
A repository containing a variety of re-usable A-Frame components, and examples of A-Frame component usage.

Content is currently organized into:

- components - Re-usable A-Frame components
- component-usage - Examples illustrating the usage of a specific component (which may be in this repo, or external)
- compositions - More complex examples that involve composition of multiple A-Frame components.

I also have a range of other A-Frame components in other repositories.  Over time, I may move some of that into here, but for now feel free to browse those as well, and take anything you find useful (pretty much everything is MIT license - though please do check individual repository licenses as there could be exceptions)

### Utility Components

Components that exist to support examples.  Not likely to be very useful in their own right.

| **Component**                                                | Description                                                  |

| [scale-on-hover](https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/aframe-examples/docs/utility-components.html) | Scale an object up when hovered over by the mouse            |
| [hide-on-hover](https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/aframe-examples/docs/utility-components.html) | Hide an object when hovered over by the mouse                |
| [output-screen-position](https://diarmidmackenzie.github.io/aframe-examples/docs/screen-position.html) | Track and report the 2D screen position of an A-Frame entity (as reported by `screen-position`) |





Include a component in your project like this (fill in [component-name] with the appropriate component)

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/diarmidmackenzie/aframe-examples@latest/components/[component-name].min.js"></script>
```

Some high-level components have multiple dependencies, and require multiple components to be included in the project. See individual component documentation pages for details.

I do plan to use npm to simplify some of these dependencies, but haven't got to it yet.  If you'd like to see a particular component on npm, please raise an issue, and I'll try to prioritize it.



## Component Usage

For components in this repository, see component pages linked above for examples

We don't currently have any examples for usage of components from outside this repository.



## Compositions

#### Wrapped Present

Wrap a virtual gift (any PNG image), for desktop or mobile (not VR)
